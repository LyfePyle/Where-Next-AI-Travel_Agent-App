# Weather Autocomplete Setup

## üéØ What's New

I've added **city autocomplete functionality** to the weather search bar! Now when you type in a city name, you'll get real-time suggestions from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## üîß Setup Required

### 1. Get OpenWeatherMap API Key

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard
4. The free tier includes:
   - 1,000 calls/day for weather data
   - 1,000 calls/day for geocoding (city search)

### 2. Add to Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `where-next` directory and add:

```bash
# Weather API Configuration
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# Other existing keys...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
# ... etc
```

## ‚ú® Features Added

### CityAutocomplete Component
- **Real-time search**: Type 2+ characters to get suggestions
- **Debounced API calls**: Prevents excessive API requests
- **Keyboard navigation**: Use arrow keys, Enter, Escape
- **Click outside to close**: User-friendly dropdown behavior
- **Loading indicator**: Shows when searching for cities

### API Endpoint
- **`/api/utils/city-search`**: New endpoint for city search
- **Uses OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API**: Returns cities with coordinates
- **Formatted results**: City name, state (if available), country

### Updated Weather Search
- **Replaced basic input** with CityAutocomplete component
- **Better UX**: Users can select from suggestions instead of typing exact names
- **Reduced errors**: No more "city not found" due to typos

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Go to `/utilities` page
2. Click on the "Weather" tab
3. Start typing a city name (e.g., "par")
4. See suggestions appear (e.g., "Paris, France", "Paris, TX, United States")
5. Click on a suggestion or use keyboard navigation
6. Click "Check Weather" to get the forecast

## üîç Example Searches

Try typing these to see autocomplete in action:
- "new y" ‚Üí New York, New York City, etc.
- "lond" ‚Üí London, United Kingdom
- "tok" ‚Üí Tokyo, Japan

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Weather API key not configured"
- Make sure you've added `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` to your `.env.local`
- Restart your development server after adding the key

### "No suggestions appearing"
- Check that your API key is valid
- Verify you have remaining API calls (free tier: 1,000/day)
- Check browser console for any errors

### "Cities not found"
- The geocoding API might not have every city
- Try more specific searches (e.g., "New York" instead of "NYC")
- Some cities might be under different names

## üìù Next Steps

Once you add your OpenWeatherMap API key to `.env.local`, the autocomplete will work immediately! The feature is fully integrated and ready to use.
